## Methodology Explanation

### 1. Document Processing
- Uses PDFMiner.six for robust PDF text extraction
- Implements hierarchical section detection based on:
  - Font size analysis
  - Layout structure recognition
  - Text block positioning
- Performs text cleaning and normalization:
  - Unicode normalization (NFKD)
  - Special character removal
  - Whitespace standardization
- Maintains document structure integrity with page mapping

### 2. Persona Analysis
- Leverages spaCy's NLP pipeline for text processing:
  - Tokenization and lemmatization
  - Part-of-speech tagging
  - Named entity recognition
- Implements keyword extraction algorithm:
  - Removes stopwords and punctuation
  - Applies lemmatization for word normalization
  - Creates frequency-based keyword importance
- Calculates relevance scores using:
  - Keyword matching
  - Section position weighting
  - Content length consideration

### 3. Output Generation
- Generates structured JSON output containing:
  - Processing metadata and timestamps
  - Ranked sections with importance scores
  - Refined text summaries
- Implements proper error handling and validation
- Maintains consistent output format across runs

### 4. Docker Implementation
- Uses slim Python base image for minimal size
- Implements multi-stage build process
- Includes necessary system dependencies
- Provides volume mounting for input/output
- Ensures reproducible builds

### Limitations
- Basic keyword matching for relevance scoring
- No advanced semantic analysis
- Limited handling of complex document layouts
- Basic text summarization approach
- Single language support (English)

### Future Improvements
- Incorporate transformer-based NLP models
- Add multilingual support
- Implement advanced text summarization
- Enhance section detection with ML
- Add support for additional document formats
- Optimize Docker image size further
- Implement batch processing capabilities
